<h1>Argentiere - New Year 2001/2</h1>
We spent New Year Week 
in Argentiere, France; there was a big family reunion with Gilly's
60th birthday, Mike, Katie, Brian and Helen and many local
friends.  Beautiful sunshine, lots of excitement for kids
and even a couple of afternoons of skiing for grownups!
