<h1>Tim's 5th Birthday</h1>
<p>Tim turned 5 on 21 February 2002. He had a big party at Kids Club at the 
Centre Court and a couple of smaller ones at home.  The grown ups had their 
turn at celebrating (alas without the guest of honour who went to bed at 8 pm)
 at a soiree which went until a very late hour, last guests leaving at 1 am.      </p>

All those activities make you rather hungry!
