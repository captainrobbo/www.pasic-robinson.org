Family website, now stored in GitHub, after WebFaction shut down.

This contains my braindead static site generator written 15 years ago.  Run `build.py` and it generates a lot of HTML from .ini files.   Everything lives in GitHub; I hope I can configure GitHub Pages to serve it with a custom domain.
