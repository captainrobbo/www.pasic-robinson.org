title=Holiday in Thailand
dateline=February 2007 
blurb=We followed our usual pattern of taking the main family holiday at February half term.  Fortunately we were doing business with a number of hotel chains in the region and were able to combine several meetings in Bangkok with a great holiday.  We did jungly stuff in Chiang Main, beachy stuff in Krabi, then chilled out at our favourite family hotel (Holiday Inn Phuket) for the last few days, including <a href="../2_tims_birthday/">Tim's birthday</a> which forms the next story.
