<h1>Tim's 10th birthday</h1>
<comment>Thailand, 21 Feb 2007</comment>
<p>Tim's birthday fell during our <a href="../1_thailand/">holiday in Thailand</a>.  In fact he chose the location - they had so  much fun the year before at the Holiday Inn kids' club that he insisted on going back and we booked our last 4 days there.  His favourite teacher from school, Miss Ralph, now works in Thailand and she came to see us for the day. The hotel laid on a great party for us and some new friends...
