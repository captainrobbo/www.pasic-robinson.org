dateline=October half term 
blurb=We had some meetings and a conference in New York which coincided with half term, so we took the chance to show the kids the city.  We had 4 days of glorious sunshine (during which we took the photos) then 3 of nonstop rain.  We climbed buildings, visited relatives, shopped and so on...
