title=Seychelles Customer Visit
dateline=March 2007 
blurb=In the winter we signed a deal with the Seychelles Tourism Board to build an eBrochure solution to show off the islands.  Naturally, a site visit was involved, and we spent a week in their offices.  But we managed to enjoy the weekend before and after, and a final night at the Hilton Northolme Resort.  It really is one of the most beautiful places in the world...
