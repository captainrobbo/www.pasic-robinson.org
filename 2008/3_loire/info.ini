title=Chateaux in the Loire
dateline= May half term
blurb= Alisa's parents, Izet and Tefika, came through in May.  They had not been to France for a long time so we booked a gorgeous country gite near Tours for 5 days and saw lots of Chateaux.  It rained a lot, but we made up for it by dining on duck and fine wine, and saw sights whenever it cleared up..
