title: Latin American Tour

introduction:
  In late January we set off for a tour of Latin America.  
  Flew into Sao Paolo for a night, then Lima, Cusco and Macchu Picchu, 
  Arequipa, Santiago, across the Amdes from Puerto Montt to Bariloche, 
  Mendoza, Buenos Aires and back via Sao Paolo!  
  This page is just the Peru phase so far.
