title: Latin America

description:
  In late January we set off for a tour of Latin America. 
  We flew into Sao Paolo, then on to Lima, Cusco and Macchu 
  Picchu and Arequipa in Peru; Santiago in Chile; then across 
  the Amdes from Puerto Montt to Bariloche in Argentina; 
  then Mendoza, Buenos Aires and back via Sao Paolo! 
  This page just covers Lima - later stages are in the side menu.
