title: Latin America

description:
  In late January we set off for a tour of Latin America. 
  We flew into Sao Paolo, then on to Lima, Cusco and Macchu 
  Picchu and Arequipa in Peru; Santiago in Chile; then across 
  the Amdes from Puerto Montt to Bariloche in Argentina; 
  then Mendoza, Buenos Aires and back via Sao Paolo! 
  This page just covers Lima - later stages are in the side menu.

        Our hotel was alongside a lovely green park, El Olivar, in the San Ysdiro district,
        midway between historic downtown and touristy Miraflores.

        On the first evening we walked down along the Malecon and had our
        first Pisco sour and Cusco beer watching the sun go down.
