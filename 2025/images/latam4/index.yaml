title: Chile

description:
  We flew four hours south to Santiago in Chile.  Staying in super-modern Providencia
  was a shock - it's like Singapore under the Andes!  We had three nights in a lovely
  hotel with their forest park on one side, and the modern city on the other.

         On our first day we booked a tour to the Concha y Toro vineyards in the Maipo Valley,
         south of Santiago

         Day two was a tour to Valparaiso - Latin America's biggest port before the Panama Canal opened,
         but now an artist's colony with beautiful historic buildings.  And then on to the seaside
         resort of Vina del Mar just up the coast.
