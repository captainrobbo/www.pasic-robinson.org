title: Bariloche, Argentina

description:
  Our bus climbed up and over the top, and descended into the forests above Bariloche, Argentina's Lake District.
  We wound our way down through ski villages,  lakes, and some very un-European Cowboy-style pampas.

         Wow.  Just like Chamonix or Colorado or something!  Bariloche
         was packed with Brazilians escaping the heat to buy chocolates
         and have an Alpine experience.

         We were a bit unlucky to have high winds and clouds on our full day,
         so we did what the locals do, browsed chocolates blagging samples,
         then went for a large steak and Malbec
