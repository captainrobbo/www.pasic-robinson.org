            After herculean efforts doing two complete renovations, both boys are now on the property ladder, each in a 2 bedrooom
            flat near Vauxhall and sharing with friends.   We nearly killed ourselves, twice
            over, for 3 months each, trying to coordinate renovations during the pandemic,
            and ended up doing way too much of it ourselves as successive builders vanished.<br>
            Luckily, friends helped out - Tom helping us fix brickwork up a scaffold and advising
            throughout on pipes and plumbing.<br><br>
            Then there's the saga of the beach house in Croatia, with it's 1980s plumbing and wiring;
            after years talking about it, we hope the renovation is happening.  We spent 3 exhausting
            days clearing out 4 decades of clutter and old furniture.<br><br>
            Meanwhile at home we had damp problems with the neighbours' drive against our wall, which
            took forever to resolve and caused us a lot of stress (as well as damage to our study wall).
            We also had to dig a hole in the kitchen floor (mercifully finding the sagging tiles were a
            broken timber and not damp-rot).    Our own home still awaits serious attention, 
            with a new kitchen and rear needing doing in 2022 or 2023, but we can't face that just now.

            By August, everyone was vaccinated and travel could resume.  First priority was to get Alisa's mum
            (who had spent 18 months alone in her apartmet in Sweden) down to the seaside, and give her some company.
            <br><br>
            We left London in pouring rain, and 3 hours later we were in beautiful Trogir enjoying the old
            town.  The next day, Roko and Snjezana picked us up, we headed into Bosnia (with the obligatory
            amazing meal by a lake), and caught up with Tefika.  Andy was able to get his Tokyo Olympics fix on
            wifi over 3-Euro gourmet breakfasts while Alisa saw all the friends and relatives.  Then we high-tailed it
            to the beach house, after a quick pause to get our noses tested before crossing the border back into the EU.

            <br><br>
            Duboka was as calm and beautiful as ever.  All our usual friends rolled in from aroundd Europe.
            Sasha and Lela coached Andy in the fine local skill of lunchtime Rakija-tasting and having a siesta
            on the terrace their dad built.

            After two weeks, we bid farewell to Tefika, and decided to see the Croatia all the tourists see -
            something we had not really down.  Two nights and a boat trip (with 100 hard-partying Polish students) 
            in Makarska, a stop in Split to meet the organiser of next month's AthTech conference and plan, and
            two more nights on the waterfront in Trogir by the airport capped off an amazing 20 days.
