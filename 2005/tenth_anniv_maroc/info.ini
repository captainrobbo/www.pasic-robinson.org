title=Tenth Anniversary in Marrakech
dateline=27-31 May 2005
blurb=Our anniversary was at half term so the kids went off to <br>
 their grandparents and we escaped for four days in Marrakech, <br>
 Morocco.  We stayed in an exquisitely restored Riad - a boutique <br>
 hotel - in  the heart of the old town named <i>Dar Les Cigognes</i>, <br>
 or <i>"House of Storks"</i>. Not that we want any more storks visiting us....<br> 
 It's a beautiful and atmospheric city with a great mixture of Arab and French culture.
