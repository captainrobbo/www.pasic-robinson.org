<h1>Tim's 8th Birthday</h1>
<comment>21st February 2005</comment>
<p>Tim's actual birthday was spent on skis (beat that for a treat!)<br>
but he still managed to blag two parties afterwards. The main one was in <br>
the Odeon cinema where 15 of them watched <i>Spongebob Squarepants</i> then <br>
had games and tea.<br>
