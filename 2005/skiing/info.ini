title=Skiing in Argentiere
dateline=February half term
blurb=After 3 years of patiently lugging kids gear to the slopes,<br>
 this was breakthrough time. Both boys spent a week in the ESF ski<br>
 school and moved from "flocons" (snowflakes) to their first stars.<br>
 We took them up a mountain and their mum couldn't keep up.<br>
 They actually skate downhill to get more speed!<br>
