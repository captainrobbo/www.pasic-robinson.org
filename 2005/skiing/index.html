<h1>Skiing in Argentiere</h1>
<comment>February half term</comment>
<p>After 3 years of patiently lugging kids gear to the slopes,<br>
this was breakthrough time. Both boys spent a week in the ESF ski<br>
school and moved from "flocons" (snowflakes) to their first stars.<br>
We took them up a mountain and their mum couldn't keep up.<br>
They actually skate downhill to get more speed!<br>
