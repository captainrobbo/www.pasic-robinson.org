title=USA - California and Arizona
dateline=Easter holidays, March
blurb=Andy had a conference in San Diego and customers in Phoenix and LA,<br>
 so we flew over to see Alisa's family in Phoenix, hired a car and did Southern<br>
 California.  We treated the boys to an 'all the resorts' pass and saw Disneyland, <br>
 Knott's Berry Farm, Sea World and the San Diego Zoo.  While in San Diego, we also <br>
 popped over the border to Tijuana in Mexico.  In LA hooked up with our<br>
 old friends the Johnsons, and had a night out in LA style on Sunset Boulevard<br>
 (the sushi was Divine) while our and their kids wrecked the Johnson home and talked the<br>
 babysitter into feeding them sugar and ice.  Of course the English weather tracked <br>
 us down and flooded the City - locals kept hearing our accents and blaming us!<br>
 <p>The mood was not all holidays, as Alisa's uncle was in intensive care in Phoenix<br>
 following bypass surgery, but he's much better now...<br>
