title=Croatia
dateline= July 2009
blurb= Ho hum.  Same old mediterranean paradise as usual, in the family beach house!<br/>This year the boy's Spanish cousin Adela came to visit.  We then escaped to the idyllic island of Mljet (historic Mileta, where Odysseus he took a seven year break on his travels) for a few days.
